# User Registration and First Login

## Registration Steps

If you are new to SRT and also do not have a MAX.gov login, your registration is a two step 
process.  Part 1 is sending your email address to the SRT system owner so they can assign
you the proper role and access in the system. Part 2 is to go through the self-regisration 
steps with with max.gov. You do _**not**_ need to wait for the SRT system owner to setup 
your email address before starting on Step 2. Self registration on MAX should roughly go 
through the following steps:

* In a web browser, open https://test.max.gov (for the production when it is launched, this link 
will be https://max.gov)  
* Click the Register Now button
* If possible, choose the Register with PIV/CAC option
* Complete the self-registration according to the directions provided
* If you need assistance with MAX registration, they have a dedicated help desk you can reach by phone at 202-395-6860 
* After the registration process is complete, I recommend logging out of MAX and possibly clearing your browser cache of 
the session you have created there

## Login Process

Do not follow these steps until you have completed your MAX registration **and** the SRT system owner
has configured your role. You must use the PIV/CAC option when logging into SRT.  There is a known issue
that logging into MAX with a username/password or a non-PIV 2 factor authentication can result in a 
login loop of sorts where you won't be able to access the SRT application.  The fix for this condition
is to go directly to https://test.max.gov/ , log in there, then click the logout link found in the drop down
menu under your name in the upper right corner of the screen, finally (if necessary) clear your browser cache.

**To login to SRT:**
* Start at https://srt.app.cloud.gov/
* Click the Login with MAX button
* Click the Continue with PIV/CAC button
* Perform the necessary steps to use your PIV card (enter pin, etc)
* You should then be redirected to the SRT application menu page
